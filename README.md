# Dropout-Regularization
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for binary classification
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for binary classification using the Sonar dataset, which contains sonar signals bounced off metal cylinders (M) and roughly cylindrical rocks (R). The dataset has 60 numerical features and a target column, which was converted into a binary format (Rock = 1, Metal = 0). The data was split into training and testing sets, and an ANN was built using Keras with one input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer. The project compares the performance of a standard ANN with an ANN that includes Dropout layers, demonstrating that adding Dropout improves generalization and test accuracy by preventing overfitting. Both models were evaluated using test accuracy, classification reports, and predictions, highlighting the practical impact of Dropout in neural networks for classification tasks.
